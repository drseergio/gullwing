INSTALL: how to get your gentoo system ready to run gullwing

VERSION: contains the version number of gullwing; if pistons.R, engine.R, catalyst.R,
         monte_carlo.R are modified then the number must be updated

doc/: design docs, ideas, etc

pistons.R: backbone of almost all applications, contains functions that do the actual work

engine.R: the main program that calculates breakout points and buy opportunities;
          this code is run in production and must be kept in sync with semurg

engine.yaml: contains configuration of the search algorithm (parameters)

exterior.R: generates charts for selected symbols in specified time-frames

catalyst.R: runs a single simulation

catalyst.yaml: contains configuration of the simulator

monte_carlo.R: runs many simulations to find optimal parameters

db.yaml: contains configuration to access the database in which results and data
         are stored

db.sql: SQL schema for MySQL database to get gullwing running

quotes.py: fetches price data from Yahoo and stores in database; results are used
           by R programs

screener.py: screens stocks by market capitalization and other parameters using
