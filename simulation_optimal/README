The purpose of this simulation is to execute trades with
constraints of a limited cash account. In other words, the
simulation will only execute transactions if there is enough
cash available to make the purchase.

This simulation will not execute every possible trade.

Simulation assumes that engine.R and a list of transactions is stored in the database (exhause.R) has been run.
