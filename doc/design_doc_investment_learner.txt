Question:
===============
How do we identify good investment?

Definition (good investment:) 
===============
Highest returns projected on annual return rate.

Necessary code:
===============
- calculate annualized interest on a given investment 
  double getAnnualizedInterest(Investment, Return, numberOfDays)
        return   (Return/Investment - 1) * (360/numberOfDays)

Possible Approach:
==================
1) calc annualized interest rate (AIR) for each potential investment
2) take as input the [DISCUSSION: is the list below good/complete?]
    * % of price drop
    * % of volume spike
    * absolute and mean price of the stock
    * standard deviation of the stock
    * market cap of the stock
    * [MAYBE: Risk Measures?]
       - alpha, beta, sharpratio, semiVariance,...
3) use regular machine learning techniques to predict AIR by the
  above inputs.
4) verify whether we can get > 50%
  [preferably >80%]

Alternative Approach:
==================
NOTE: the above can also be modified
into a classification problem via
sorting all investments by AIR
descending and getting the top x as
one class and the bottom y as 2nd
class. Instead of exactly predicting
the AIR, we could potentially train
whether we can find the right classes
(poor investment vs top investment)

Watchpoint
===========
This only works as the markets behave
similar to historic behavior. a crash
(i.e. 2001 or 2007/8) might harm this
short term as the
